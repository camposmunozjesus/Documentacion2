SVN Connector Issue
Submitted by Prejith Pulikkottil on Fri, 12/06/2013 - 03:52

I have installed "Subversive - SVN Team Provider 1.1.1" from Eclipse marketplace. Installation was successful. But when I connect with my SVN server, It is showing following error:

SVN: '0x00400006: Validate Repository Location' operation finished with error: Selected SVN connector library is not available or cannot be loaded.
If you selected native JavaHL connector, please check if binaries are available or install and select pure Java Subversion connector from the plug-in connectors update site.
If connectors already installed then you can change the selected one at: Window->Preferences->Team->SVN->SVN Connector.

To resolve the problem you need to install and use SVNKit

The error message explains the problem and provides information how to resolve the problem. If you use Subversive on a non-Windows platform, 
you need to install pure-Java SVNKit connector and select it on the Window->Preferences->Team->SVN->SVN Connector dialog.

You have to install SVNKit on the dialog that appears automatically after Subversive installation. Also you can install connectors using these
