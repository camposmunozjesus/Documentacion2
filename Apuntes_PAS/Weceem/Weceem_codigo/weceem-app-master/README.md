# Weceem CMS Application

This is the source code for the free Open Source Weceem Content Management System built on [Grails](http://grails.org).

The code uses the [Weceem plugin](http://github.com/jCatalog/weceem-plugin) to provide the CMS functionality, 
and the [Weceem Spring Security plugin](http://github.com/jCatalog/weceem-spring-security) to add user authentication.

This application code itself adds little more than the user administration interface.

You can build this application to produce a ready-to-use WAR file of the CMS.

Full documentation is on the [Weceem site](http://weceem.org)
